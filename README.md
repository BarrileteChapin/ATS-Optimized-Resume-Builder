# Professional CV Generator - ATS-Optimized Resume Builder

A modern, web-based CV generator designed to create ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimized resumes that help job seekers pass automated screening systems and land interviews.

## üéØ What is This Project?

This is a simple CV/Resume builder that helps job seekers create professional resumes optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). The application provides real-time ATS scoring, multiple professional templates, and generates both PDF and plain text versions of your resume.

## ü§ñ Understanding ATS Systems

### What is an ATS?

An **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is software used by over 75% of companies to automatically screen, parse, and rank job applications before they reach human recruiters. These systems:

- **Parse resume content** using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology‚Å∑
- **Extract structured data** (contact info, work experience, education, skills)
- **Match keywords** from job descriptions to resume content using Boolean search
- **Score and rank candidates** based on relevance and keyword density
- **Filter out resumes** that don't meet minimum criteria through "knockout questions"
- **Only pass top-ranked resumes** to human recruiters (often just the top 10-20%)

Popular ATS platforms include Workday, Greenhouse, Taleo (Oracle), iCIMS, Lever, and SmartRecruiters.

### Why ATS Optimization Matters

- **Up to 75% of resumes** are rejected by ATS before human review¬π
- **Over 75% of companies** now use some form of ATS¬≤
- **98% of Fortune 500 companies** use ATS systems¬≥
- Even qualified candidates get filtered out due to poor ATS compatibility
- Nearly 9 out of 10 U.S. workers believe their applications were discarded despite being capable‚Å¥

## üìä How Our ATS Score is Calculated

Our ATS scoring algorithm simulates real-world ATS systems by evaluating multiple factors that actual ATS platforms consider:

### Scoring Breakdown (Total: 100 points)

| Factor | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Contact Information** | 20 pts | Complete contact details (name, email, phone, location) |
| **Professional Summary** | 15 pts | Well-written summary (minimum 50 characters) |
| **Work Experience** | 35 pts | Multiple experiences (10 pts each, max 25) + quantified achievements (10 pts) |
| **Education** | 10 pts | Educational background included |
| **Skills** | 15 pts | Adequate skills listed (10 pts for 3+ skills, 5 pts bonus for 6+ skills) |
| **Additional Sections** | 5 pts | Certifications, projects, or languages included |

### Score Interpretation

- **80-100%**: Excellent ATS compatibility - High chance of passing screening
- **60-79%**: Good compatibility - Likely to pass with minor improvements
- **Below 60%**: Needs improvement - May be filtered out by ATS

### Data-Based Simulation

Our scoring algorithm is based on research from:
- Harvard Business School's "Hidden Workers: Untapped Talent" study (2021)‚Å¥
- ATS vendor documentation and industry analysis
- Recruiter surveys and hiring best practices
- Analysis of successful resume patterns from career counseling organizations

### How Real ATS Systems Work

When you submit a resume online, here's what actually happens:

1. **Resume Upload & Parsing**: Your file is scanned using OCR technology to extract text
2. **Data Extraction**: The system identifies and categorizes information (name, contact, experience, etc.)
3. **Keyword Matching**: Your resume is compared against the job description using Boolean search
4. **Scoring & Ranking**: You receive a compatibility score (often 0-100 or star ratings)
5. **Filtering**: Only top-ranked candidates (typically top 10-20%) are shown to recruiters
6. **Human Review**: Recruiters review the filtered list, not all applications

**Important**: If your resume scores low, it may never be seen by a human recruiter, regardless of your qualifications.

**Note**: This is a simulation based on industry data and best practices. Actual ATS systems may vary in their specific algorithms and criteria, as most companies keep their exact scoring methods proprietary.
